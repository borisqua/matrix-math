# Matrix math
This is a demo project with a simple implementation of general matrix operations.
This is not the most efficient way to do these operations. 
I choose such implementation for the sake of simplicity of understanding the general ideas.
One can use this app like a simple matrix calculator with the command line interface.

## Build and run

Required JDK 14 installed.

If JDK is ready, run the command line from the root application directory:
```bash
./start_app
```
or in Windows command console
```cmd
start_app.cmd
```
here *file.txt* is the name of the file with a text being analyzed for readability.
